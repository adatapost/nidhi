 2. Java language is statically typed or tightly type checked     language.

    There are two types of programming languages:
          1. Statically typed and 
          2. Dynamic typed

     C,C++, Java, C# are example of statically typed programming 	language.
 
     PHP, JavaScript, Ruby etc are example of dynamic typed languages.

 What is "statically typed"?
    
     The "type" of value or variable is checked during compilation as well as runtime is called "statically typed language".

      e.g     int n;   //here type of "n" variable is "int"
              n=10.10; //10.10 belongs to "double" and type of "n" is
       		       //int so the compiler refuse to compile this 			// code.
              n = 10; is the correct becuase "10" is consider as "int"
			and also type of "n" is int.

       We cannot change type of variable once it is created.

  What about dynamically typed?

       The "type" of variable & value is determined/checked by the        runtime at the time of executing a program.

       In other words, type of variable is evaluted using the value it 	represents.

	e.g PHP language:

               $no = 10; //It is number
               $no = "Hello"; //It is string 
               $no = new DateTime; //Date object

 In statically typed language, type is associate with variable & value where as in dynamically typed language, the type is associate with the value but not with variable.

  3. Java is a specification based programming language - Java      Language Specification (JLS). 

  4. Java language comes with JavaSE bundle that is also known as JDK.      Current release JDK 8 (JDK1.8). JDK will be installed on your hard drive at x:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x folder and this folder is known as JAVA_HOME.

     JDK has Java Language + Core APIs + Virtual Machine (Java Runtime 		Environment - JRE).   

     After installing JDK, we must have to set "Path" environment      variable of "X:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x\bin" folder.

     To set Path environment variable:

        1. Control Panel + System +  Advanced System Settings + Environment Variables. + Click on "New" button if "Path" is not exists and set :

            Variable Name:  Path
            Variable Value: C:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x\bin

         If suppose that the "Path" exists then click on "Edit", add ; semi-colon at the end of list and write your path.

        e.g
           Variable Name: Path
           Variable Value: c:\a;c:\pqr;...;"c:\Program Files\java\jdkx.x.x\bin";

Note: Enclosed path with double quotes if file or directoy name has whitespaces. e.g "c:\Program Files\Java\jdkx.x.x\bin"

   After setting "Path" click on OK/Finish button and start the cmd (command prompt) and issue "javac" and "java" command:
 
   >javac  press enter
   >java   press enter

 5. Java language has eight (8) built-in datatypes or classes and they 	are known as "primitive" types.
	Primitive type		Size (in bytes)
	---------------------------------------
	byte			1
	short			2
	int			4
	long			8
	float			4
	double			8
	boolean			Not Available (possibly 1 bit)
	char			2 - To store unicode character
	
	Above mentioned types are classes but they are not designed as 
	per object-orinted paradigm and hence Java language is called 	"Not pure OOP".

        Unicode means a Universal Text Format (UTF) which allow us to represents characters of English and non-English languages including Gujrati, Hinidi, Spanish etc.
