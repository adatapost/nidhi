 What is Java?
 --------------------------------------------------------------

 The Java is a platform/framework. The Java Platform further 
 divided into three platforms:
    1. Java SE - Standard Edition
    2. Java EE - Enterprize Edition (It was called J2EE in early days)
    3. Java ME - Micro Edition

 Each Java platform has two components - APIs (Application Programming Interface) or Library and Runtime environment (Java Runtime Environment - JRE).

 Only the Java SE has a language called "Java Language" and Java SE is  the foundation platform for Java EE/ME/Android.

 [Note: JRE is also called - Java Virtual MAchine - JVM]

 Platform / Framework  (What do you meant by the term "Platform"?)
 ------------------------

 A platform is a computing environment through which we can develop (code), deploy (install) and execute the applications (programs) as per specifications/guidelines.

 Bascially each & every frameworks in the world are designed using Inversion of Control (IoC) theory which tells us "Don't call us, we will call you".

At bottom (or low-level), the OS is the first platform and then we have number of sub-platforms which are installed on the OS.

Java SE
========
Java SE (also called JDK) is composed of three components :
  1. Java compiler (Language)
  2. Java Core APIs
  3. JVM (or JRE)

Java Language
--------------
1. It supports object-oriented paradigm.

     What about OOP?
          It is a program style. The object-oriented is a technique 
          to create a code which offers re-usability, and 	  extendability.

    What about an "object"?

          A partitioned area of the memory. Or 
          Collection/set of allocated/reserved bytes.

          e.g  int a;  The OS will allocates 4 bytes (32bit) and
			this four bytes group is called an object.

		Objects can be structured or unstructured. Objects whose structure is defined elsewhere is known as "structured". 

		Unstructured objects have no lay out - Their size can 
		be always in variable length of bytes. When we use 		malloc() function in C language,
                   int *p;
                   p = malloc( 20  ); //allocates 20 bytes
                      
                   malloc( 20 ) can be used to store 5 integers or
		   5 floating points or 20 characters(bytes) or
		   10 short int and so on.

   What about "Type" or "Class"?
  
            Type or Class describes the data-structure. It is also
	    known as "datatype".

	    In other words, it is a blue-print (structure) of an 	    object. The runtime environment (OS or other platform)
	    allocates memory as per specified "class/type".
